# Sticky Scroll Component Integration

## ✅ Project Structure Analysis

Your project already has the correct setup:
- ✅ shadcn project structure (components.json exists)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS (tailwindcss dependency)
- ✅ TypeScript (typescript dependency)
- ✅ React Router DOM
- ✅ Lucide React icons

## 📦 Required Dependencies

### Install Lenis (Smooth Scrolling Library)

Due to PowerShell execution policy restrictions, you'll need to install the `lenis` dependency manually:

```bash
npm install lenis
```

Or if you're using a different package manager:
```bash
yarn add lenis
# or
bun add lenis
```

## 🎯 Component Integration

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`src/components/ui/sticky-scroll.tsx`** - Main sticky scroll component
2. **`src/components/ui/demo.tsx`** - Demo component (updated)
3. **`src/pages/Gallery.tsx`** - Gallery page (updated to use sticky scroll)

### Component Features:

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Uses Lenis for buttery smooth scroll animations
- **Sticky Layout**: Center column remains sticky while side columns scroll
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <DemoOne />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you see import errors:
1. Make sure `lenis` is installed: `npm install lenis`
2. Check that TypeScript can resolve the imports
3. Verify the component paths are correct

### If the scroll isn't smooth:
1. Ensure Lenis is properly initialized
2. Check for conflicting CSS that might interfere with scroll behavior

### If images don't load:

2. Verify the Unsplash URLs are accessible
3. Consider downloading and hosting images locally for better performance
